    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_extraction : `pyannote.audio.features.FeatureExtraction`
        Feature extraction
    speech : bool, optional
        Add speech dimension.
    overlap : bool, optional
        Add overlapping speech dimension
    change : bool, optional
        Add speaker change dimensions
    collar : float, optional
        Duration of (speaker change) neighborhood, in seconds. Default to 100ms (0.1).
    duration : float, optional
        Duration of sub-sequences. Defaults to 3.2s.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size. Defaults to 32.
    per_epoch : float, optional
        Total audio duration per epoch, in days.
        Defaults to one day (1).
    parallel : int, optional
        Number of prefetching background generators. Defaults to 1.
        Each generator will prefetch enough batches to cover a whole epoch.
        Set `parallel` to 0 to not use background generators.
